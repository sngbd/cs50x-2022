sort1 uses: Bubble sort
How do you know?: It is the slowest one of all three binary files, except when sorting sorted numbers. Which shows that sorted numbers
reduces the amount of work required for bubble sort to swap numbers.
sort2 uses: Merge sort
How do you know?: Because it is the fastest one of all three binary files. It also seems to show sorted number half by half when sorting big numbers.
sort3 uses: Selection sort
How do you know?: It performs poorly in comparison to sort1 when sorting sorted number because bubble sort (sort1 guess) works faster on sorted numbers
than selection sort. Selection sort iterates through all of the list first to check for the smallest number while bubble sort just swaps
pairs of numbers if the order is incorrect, which there isn't on sorted numbers.
